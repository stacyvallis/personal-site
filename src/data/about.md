# Background

I am currently employed as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Digital Futures at School of Architecture and Built Environment at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Stockholm, Sweden. My research is situated at the intersection of digitalisation, public wellbeing, and architectural design, to develop human-centred solutions for smart urban Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services through the application of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) discourse, to enhance disaster resilience in Sustainable Smart Cities. This study is informed by the research undertaken within the Digital Futures Research Group “Humanising the Sustainable Smart City (HiSS)”, as part of the Digital Futures consortium between KTH, Stockholm University, and the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE).
I am passionate about the use of cultural heritage and intergenerational dialogue as tools for addressing many societal challenges. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch!
