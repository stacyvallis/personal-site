# Background

I am currently employed as a Lecturer in Architecture and Emerging Technologies at The School of Future Environments, Auckland University of Technology (AUT), in Auckland, New Zealand. Since completing my PhD in 2020, I have worked in professional architecture practice in Sydney, Australia before undertaking a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Digital Futures at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. This study was informed by the research undertaken within the Digital Futures Research Group “Humanising the Sustainable Smart City (HiSS)”, as part of the Digital Futures consortium between KTH, Stockholm University, and the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE). My research and teaching pursues human-centred applications of emerging technologies within Sustainable Smart Cities to address multiple environmental challenges and to enhance disaster resilience and public well-being. I am passionate about the use of cultural heritage and intergenerational dialogue as tools for addressing societal issues.
